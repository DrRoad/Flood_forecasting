Fix the minor interactivity problems between map and plot in both the single and multi station visualization
For example the fact that the plot doesn't delete the last line when the selection is back to empty

The single station tab could have a cumulative model selection and a input/runoff/state selection
Eventually we could even put the option to select multiple stations on this same tab and delete the specific multi-station tab

In the multi-station tab, make an automatic increase of the plotOutput size. this could be tricky but important
and might require using a single-station ploting function many times, reather than faceting with ggplot

Look at boxplots for LH50-90 and maybe shading for PM50, in order to have a more varied visual impression than just a bunch of lines.
This could partially fix the problem of having different line types for diferent models. 
If we stick to different line types, a legend is needed.

Add a tab with tables. We need to be able to search for a station by name.
Need to think about the design and maybe coming bak to the idea of doing a station selection tab.
An option to save groups of stations could be very interesting!

a -10000 remains in HBV_2016 and maybe in return levels too: double check

In NVEDATA: add ODM by reading the http json/txt (webchartservice)
Grid data could be added at a later stage: "grid time series" in wiki
htsr = hydra observed
qc: hourly quantile
qm: daily quantile

Do some ? info points using bsmodal
