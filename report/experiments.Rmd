This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

getwd()
setwd("..")
source("global.R")

# source("../../Flood_forecasting/global.R")

```



```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Once you get out of the first chunk, where I set the working directory 1 directory higher, the wd comes back to where the rmd file sits
getwd()

plot(cars)

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
