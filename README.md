# Contributing

## Improving the documentation

The documentation is a work-in-progress at http://NVE.github.io/Flood_forecasting/app
It is build automatically by *travis-ci* from *Rmd* files located in the `/report` directory. 
An automatic report (also based on RStudio's Rmarkdown) is being tested but is not updated everyday yet.

If you want to contribute to this documentation website, either send me your contribution in *mardown* format by email, do a formal pull request to this repository, or ask to be added as collaborator to this project.


## Filing issues

Please try to follow those guidelines for filing issues:

One issue for one purpose. Don't add more than one bug, feature request, documentation request, question, etc.. on to the same issue.

- If you've found a bug, thanks for reporting!
- If you've a request of some kind, e.g., feature request or documentation request, it'd be much appreciated if you could add **[Request]** at the beginning of the title. This helps us to prioritise easily without having to go through the entire issue.
- If you need support, e.g., installation issues or upgrade issues, please add **[Support]** at the beginning of the title. This helps us to easily identify the most common support issues, and provide solutions in a separate page.
- If you have a general question, add **[Question]** at the beginning of the title.
- If you've an issue that doesn't fall into any of these categories, then it'd be helpful if you could add **[Misc]** to your title.
